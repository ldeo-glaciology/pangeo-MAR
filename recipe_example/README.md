# Examples of recipes from the paleo-pism project

This directory contains examples of a recipe that was developed for pangeo-forge to put paleo-pim simulations in into pangeo-forge. 

It also has two notebooks which show some of the details of how I arrived at the recipe and some ways to load the date in other ways.
